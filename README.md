### **Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis**  
This project focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze restaurant reviews and determine whether they are **positive or negative**. Using **CountVectorizer**, I transformed text data into numerical features and trained multiple **Machine Learning models**, including:  
âœ… **NaÃ¯ve Bayes**  
âœ… **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
âœ… **Logistic Regression**  

After comparing their accuracies, I selected the best-performing model to ensure optimal predictions. I then built an **end-to-end Flask application**, allowing users to input their reviews and get instant sentiment analysis feedback. Finally, I deployed the project, making it accessible online.  

ðŸš€ **Tech Stack Used:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Flask, HTML/CSS, and Deployment Services.
